## Getting started

You'll need to [install Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/) if you haven't already. Check the `.ruby-version` file to see which one we're using.

Install the dependencies:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Run Jekyll:

```
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

Open it up in your browser: <http://localhost:4000/>
