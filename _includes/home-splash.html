    <h2 id="shared-services">Shared Services</h2>
      <p>We believe that organizers shouldn’t have to start from scratch. When
      you’re trying to get the word out, you shouldn’t have to learn how AWS
      works. If you want to accept donations, you shouldn’t have to hire an
      accountant. We provide organizers and civic hackers with both bureaucratic
      know-how and nuts-and-bolts tech tools so they can get right to work.</p>
    <h2 id="community--training">Community &amp; Training</h2>
      <p>The District is full of great people with great ideas. We are lucky to
      know a few of them, but there are countless more. We serve as a convener,
      making connections to bring like-minded people together, to match
      complementary skills, or to develop ideas through human-centered research
      and design.</p>
    <h2 id="fiscal-sponsorship">Fiscal Sponsorship</h2>
      <p>Creating and maintaining a 501(c)(3) is not a trivial task, but it can
      be essential for receiving the donations that are a key part of a
      project’s existence. We’ve jumped through those hoops, and want to share
      the benefits with other like-minded groups, both formal and informal, that
      share the purpose outlined in our articles of incorporation.</p>
