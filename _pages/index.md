  ### Shared Services
  We believe that organizers shouldn't have to start from scratch. When you're trying to get the word out, you shouldn't have to learn how AWS works. If you want to accept donations, you shouldn't have to hire an accountant. We provide organizers and civic hackers with both bureaucratic know-how and nuts-and-bolts tech tools so they can get right to work.

  ### Community & Training
  The District is full of great people with great ideas. We are lucky to know a few of them, but there are countless more. We serve as a convener, making connections to bring like-minded people together, to match complementary skills, or to develop ideas through human-centered research and design.

  ### Fiscal Sponsorship
  Creating and maintaining a 501(c)(3) is not a trivial task, but it can be essential for receiving the donations that are a key part of a project's existence. We've jumped through those hoops, and want to share the benefits with other like-minded groups, both formal and informal, that share the purpose outlined in our articles of incorporation.

## Donate
We are a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit, and our programs are entirely supported through donations and grants.

Help us keep this all going by making a donation of any size---it all helps!
