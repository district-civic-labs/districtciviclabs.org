## Donate
We are a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) non-profit, and our programs are entirely supported through donations and grants.

Help us keep this all going by making a donation of any size---it all helps!

## Sponsored Organizations

Through fiscal sponsorship, these organizations share in our 501(c)(3) status, so donations to them are tax deductible. If you'd like to donate specifically to them, it's slightly better to click through and use the form on their own site.

If you're interested in fiscal sponsorship for your own project or organization, [contact us](mailto:team@districtciviclabs.org)! We're interested in sponsorship opportunities that align with the purposes described in our [articles of incorporation](/docs/articles).
